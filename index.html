      <h1> hi i'm emily </h1>
      <p> I develop and design cool things usually
          in the color blue. Currently balancing working 3 jobs, leading 3
          organizations, and studying full time. I like tiring myself either by
          running marathons or losing sleep at hackathons. I also drink loads of
          boba, play thousands of hours of LoL, and sometimes drive 200 miles to
          see my annoying siblings.
